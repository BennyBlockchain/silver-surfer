        <h5>What is the CS Major all about? </h5>
        
        The Computer Science Major emphasizes scientific and technical aspects of computing. A background and interest in mathematics is very helpful.
        In addition to introductory programming courses, students may study computer hardware organization, operating systems, systems programming, 
        data communication, theory of computation, and principles of programming languages. Major requirements include courses in mathematics and a 
        multi-person team software development project; off-campus internships are strongly recommended. Computer science is often combines with a 
        major or minor in mathematics, but is worthwhile with virtually any other discipline. Career directions include system programming, technical 
        support, and research. Graduates are employed by computer hardware and software vendors, large and medium-sized companies, and colleges and universities.

        <h5>What is the MPSD major all about? </h5>

        The demand for software developers increases every day, and especially so for people who know how to design software for different 
        devices -- smart phones, tablets and computers. From programming and database theory to web development, the Multi-Platform Software Development 
        major will immerse you in the technological skills required for success in this growing field. Course requirements include a multi-person team
        software development project, and we strongly recommend that students participate in off-campus intership experiences. When combined with our 
        strong liberal arts foundation, you will not only be technically prepared for your career, you also will be equipped with the effective communication
        and leadership skills valued in today's professional world.
